# Veppo API

This is a ExpressJS application that serves data to Porto Alegre's bus webApp.

## Setup

#### Node.js

The server requires Node.js and NPM installed. If you do not have Node.js, you should run:

```sh
nvm use
nvm install
```

#### Server dependencies

After NodeJS is ready, project dependencies must be installed:

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the application

To start the web server, inside project folder, run:

```sh
npm start
```

You can deliver the bundled app from the server, but first, you have to build it.

## Testing

To run application tests, run:

```
npm test
```
